# resize

**Written in Python 2 in 2002. Unmaintained since then, but presented here for historic interest and potential usefulness, however there are now far, far better ways of doing what this script does, and you should use modern methods instead!**

A script for batch resizing images, using the [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) tool. Both interactive and command line interfaces (e.g. ```resize.py original_image_dir resize_percentage output_dir)``` are available. Licensed under the GNU General Public License.
